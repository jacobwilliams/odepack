!!### Synopsis
!!
!! _DLSODA_ solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
!! systems of first order ODEs of the form
!!```text
!!     dy/dt = f(t,y),  or, in component form,
!!     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
!!```
!! with automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
!!
!! This a variant version of the _DLSODE_ package.
!! It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
!! This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
!! problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
!! appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!### Summary of Usage
!!
!! Communication between the user and the _DLSODA_ package, for normal
!! situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
!! of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
!! details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
!! optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
!! instructions for special situations.  See also the example
!! problem (with program and output) following this summary.
!!
!!#### Section A.
!! First provide a subroutine of the form:
!!```fortran
!!               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!!               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!!```
!! which supplies the vector function _f_ by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
!!
!!#### Section B.
!! Write a main program which calls Subroutine _DLSODA_ once for
!! each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
!! for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
!! by _DLSODA_.  On the first call to _DLSODA_, supply arguments as follows:
!!
!! F
!!
!! : name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
!!   This name must be declared External in calling program.
!!
!! NEQ
!!
!! : number of first order ODEs.
!!
!! Y
!!
!! : array of initial values, of length NEQ.
!!
!! T
!!
!! : the initial value of the independent variable.
!!
!! TOUT
!!
!! : first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
!!
!! ITOL
!!
!! : 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a single or multi-value array.
!!
!! RTOL
!!
!! : relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
!!
!! ATOL
!!
!! : absolute tolerance parameter (array).
!!   the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
!!   to be less than
!!```text
!!        EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
!!        EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
!!```
!!   Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
!!   either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
!!   or the relative error is less than RTOL.
!!
!!   Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
!!   use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
!!   control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
!!   local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
!!
!! ITASK
!!
!! : 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
!!
!! ISTATE
!!
!! : integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
!!
!! IOPT
!!
!! : 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
!!
!! RWORK
!!
!! : real work array of length at least:
!!```text
!!         22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9).
!!```
!!   See also _Section E_ below.
!!
!! LRW
!!
!! : declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
!!
!! IWORK
!!
!! : integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
!!
!! LIW
!!
!! : declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
!!
!! JAC
!!
!! : name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
!!   Use a dummy name.  See also _Section E_ below.
!!
!! JT
!!
!! : Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
!!   See also _Section E_ below.
!!   Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
!!   and possibly ATOL.
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!#### Section C.
!! The output from the first call (or any call) is:
!!
!! Y
!!
!! : array of computed values of y(t) vector.
!!
!! T
!!
!! : corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
!!
!! ISTATE
!! : Status values are returned in ISTATE:
!!
!!  values  | descriptions
!!  ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
!!     2    | if _DLSODA_ was successful, negative otherwise.
!!    -1    | means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
!!    -2    | means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
!!    -3    | means illegal input detected (see printed message).
!!    -4    | means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
!!    -5    | means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
!!          |       supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
!!    -6    | means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
!!          |       component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
!!    -7    | means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
!!
!!
!!#### Section D.
!! To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
!! reset TOUT and call _DLSODA_ again.  No other parameters need be reset.
!!
!!#### Section E.
!! *Note*: If and when _DLSODA_ regards the problem as stiff, and
!! switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
!! Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
!! inputs to _DLSODA_ recommended in _Section B_ above cause _DLSODA_ to
!! treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
!! difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
!! matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
!! array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
!! J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
!! argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
!! RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!! Example Problem.
!!
!! The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
!! needed for its solution by _DLSODA_.  The problem is from chemical
!! kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
!!```text
!!     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
!!     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
!!     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
!!```
!! on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
!!```text
!!     y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
!!```
!!
!! The following coding solves this problem with _DLSODA_,
!! printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
!! ITOL = 2, and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
!! y2 has much smaller values.
!! At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
!! printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

!!#### Full description of user interface to _DLSODA_.
!!
!! The user interface to _DLSODA_ consists of the following parts.
!!
!! 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine _DLSODA_, which is a driver
!!      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
!!      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
!!      following these descriptions is a description of
!!      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
!!      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
!!
!! 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the _DLSODA_ package that may be
!!      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
!!      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
!!      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
!!
!! 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
!!      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
!!      of the problem and continued solution later.
!!
!! 4.   Description of a subroutine in the _DLSODA_ package,
!!      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
!!      this relates to the measurement of errors.
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!##### Part 1.  Call Sequence.
!!
!! The call sequence parameters used for input only are
!!
!!     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, JT,
!!
!! and those used for both input and output are
!!
!!     Y, T, ISTATE.
!!
!! The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
!! optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
!! to the return from Subroutine _DLSODA_ to the user's calling program.)
!!
!! The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
!! initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
!! change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
!!
!! The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows:
!!
!! F
!!
!! : the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
!! ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
!! form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
!! of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
!! compute the function f.  It is to have the form
!!```fortran
!!      SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
!!      DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
!!```
!! where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
!! is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
!! Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
!! F must be declared External in the calling program.
!!
!! Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
!! NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!! (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!! See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
!!
!! If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
!! externally to _DLSODA_, an extra call to F should be made
!! for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
!! If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
!!
!! NEQ
!!
!! : the size of the ODE system (number of first order
!! ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
!! NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
!! If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
!! remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
!! these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
!!
!! Normally, NEQ is a single value, and it is generally referred to
!! as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
!! NEQ must be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
!! (The _DLSODA_ package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
!! this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
!! to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an multi-value array, locations
!! NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
!! it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
!! NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
!!
!! Y
!!
!! : a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
!! length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
!! first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
!! On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
!! values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
!! evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
!! for other purposes between calls to the solver.
!!
!! This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
!! F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
!! Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
!! pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The _DLSODA_ package accesses only
!! Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
!!
!! T
!!
!! : the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
!! first call, as the initial point of the integration.
!! on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
!! computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
!! on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
!!
!! TOUT
!!
!! : the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
!! Used only for input.
!!
!! When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
!! to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
!! For the initial t, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
!! in order to determine the direction of the integration
!! (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
!! scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
!! (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
!!
!! If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
!! the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
!! Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
!!
!! If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
!! monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
!! to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
!! TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
!! TCUR and HU).
!!
!! ITOL
!!
!! : an indicator for the type of error control.  See
!! description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
!!
!! RTOL
!!
!! : a relative error tolerance parameter,
!! an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
!! Input only.
!!
!! ATOL
!!
!! : an absolute error tolerance parameter,
!! an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
!!
!! The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
!! the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
!! control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
!! in y, according to an inequality of the form
!!
!!      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
!!
!! where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
!! The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
!! The following table gives the types (single/mult-value array) of
!! RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
!!
!!  ITOL |  RTOL    |   ATOL   |           EWT(i)
!!  ---- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------
!!   1   | single   |  single  |  RTOL\*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!!   2   | single   |  array   |  RTOL\*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!!   3   | array    |  single  |  RTOL(i)\*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
!!   4   | array    |  array   |  RTOL(i)\*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
!!
!! Even when these parameters are a single value, it needs to be an array
!! in the user's calling program, or passed as a temporary array (ie. use
!! "[NEQ]" on the call if NEQ is a scalar).
!!
!! If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
!! fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
!! error controls can be obtained by substituting a
!! user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
!! See Part 4 below.
!!
!! If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
!! run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
!! components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
!! down uniformly.
!!
!! ITASK
!!
!! : an index specifying the task to be performed.
!! Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
!!
!!  value  | descriptions
!! ------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
!!       1 | means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!!         | t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
!!       2 | means take one step only and return.
!!       3 | means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
!!         | beyond t = TOUT and return.
!!       4 | means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
!!         | t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
!!         | TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
!!         | or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
!!         | integration.  This option is useful if the problem
!!         | has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
!!       5 | means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
!!         | TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
!!
!! Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
!! (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
!! indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
!! in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
!!
!! ISTATE
!!
!! : an index used for input and output to specify the
!! the state of the calculation.
!!
!! On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows:
!!
!!  value  | descriptions
!!  ------ | -----------------------------------------------------------
!!       1 | means this is the first call for the problem
!!         | (initializations will be done).  See note below.
!!       2 | means this is not the first call, and the calculation
!!         | is to continue normally, with no change in any input
!!         | parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
!!         | (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
!!         | with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
!!         | tested for legality.)
!!       3 | means this is not the first call, and the
!!         | calculation is to continue normally, but with
!!         | a change in input parameters other than
!!         | TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
!!         | NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
!!         | and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
!!         | (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
!!
!!
!! Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
!! as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
!! input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
!! purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
!! Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
!! ISTATE = 1 on input.
!!
!! On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
!!
!!  value.   |            descriptions
!!  -------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
!!       1   | means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
!!       2   | means the integration was performed successfully.
!!      -1   | means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
!!           | steps) was done on this call, before completing the
!!           | requested task, but the integration was otherwise
!!           | successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
!!           | and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
!!           | simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
!!           | (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
!!           | In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
!!           | this error return (see below on optional inputs).
!!      -2   | means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
!!           | of the machine being used.  This was detected before
!!           | completing the requested task, but the integration
!!           | was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
!!           | parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
!!           | to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
!!           | purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
!!           | taking any steps, then an illegal input return
!!           | (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
!!      -3   | means illegal input was detected, before taking any
!!           | integration steps.  See written message for details.
!!           | Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
!!           | to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
!!           | the run to stop.
!!      -4   | means there were repeated error test failures on
!!           | one attempted step, before completing the requested
!!           | task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!!           | The problem may have a singularity, or the input
!!           | may be inappropriate.
!!      -5   | means there were repeated convergence test failures on
!!           | one attempted step, before completing the requested
!!           | task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!!           | This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
!!           | if one is being used.
!!      -6   | means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
!!           | integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
!!           | was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
!!           | The integration was successful as far as T.
!!      -7   | means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
!!           | proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
!!           | This happens when _DLSODA_ chooses to switch methods
!!           | but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
!!
!!
!! Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
!! it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
!! Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
!! regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
!! user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
!! calling the solver again.
!!
!! IOPT
!!
!! : an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
!! inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
!! The optional inputs are listed separately below.
!!          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
!!                   default values will be used in all cases.
!!          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
!!
!! RWORK
!!
!! : a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
!! first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
!! optional outputs.
!!
!! As _DLSODA_ switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!! methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
!! problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to _DLSODA_ can either
!! have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
!! or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
!! program in response to output from _DLSODA_.
!!
!!#### Fixed Length Case
!!```text
!!   If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
!!        MAX (LRN, LRS),
!!   where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
!!   current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
!!
!!   The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
!!   as follows:
!!   IF NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
!!   their default values, then
!!      LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ,
!!      LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2           if JT = 1 or 2,
!!      LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ   if JT = 4 or 5.
!!   Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
!!      LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ,
!!      LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT,
!!   where
!!      NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
!!      MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
!!               optional input,
!!      MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
!!               optional input,
!!      LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
!!      LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
!!      LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
!!```
!!
!!#### Dynamic Length Case
!!
!! If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
!! be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
!! current method.
!!
!! Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
!! _DLSODA_ starts with the nonstiff method).
!!
!! On any return from _DLSODA_, the optional output MCUR indicates the
!! current method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the previous
!! return, or if there has only been one call to _DLSODA_ and MCUR is now 2,
!! then _DLSODA_ has switched methods during the last call, and the length
!! of RWORK should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if MCUR = 2).
!! (An increase in the RWORK length is required if _DLSODA_ returned
!! ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
!!
!! After resetting the length, call _DLSODA_ with ISTATE = 3
!! to signal that change.
!!
!! LRW
!!
!! : the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
!! (This will be checked by the solver.)
!!
!! IWORK
!!
!! : an integer array for work space.
!! As _DLSODA_ switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
!! methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
!! problem, between
!!             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
!! respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to _DLSODA_ can
!! either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
!! dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
!! current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
!! RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
!! only be at least LIN = 20 .
!!
!! The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
!! optional inputs and optional outputs.
!!
!! The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
!!```text
!!   IWORK(1) = ML
!!   IWORK(2) = MU
!!```
!! These are the lower and upper half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
!! banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.  The band is defined by
!! the matrix locations (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU must
!! satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.  These are required if JT is 4 or 5,
!! and ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be the band parameters
!! for a matrix to which df/dy is only approximately equal.
!!
!! LIW
!!
!! : the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
!! (This will be checked by the solver.)
!!
!! Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
!! altered between calls to _DLSODA_ for the same problem.
!! The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
!! between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
!! optional inputs, and except for the last 3\*NEQ words of RWORK.
!! The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
!! available for use by the user outside _DLSODA_ between calls, if
!! desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
!!
!! JAC
!!
!! : the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
!! Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
!! is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
!! of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
!! of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
!! _DLSODA_ compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
!! If and when _DLSODA_ uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
!! matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
!! 4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
!! IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
!! routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
!! and the vector y.  It is to have the form
!!```fortran
!!     SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
!!     DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
!!```
!! where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
!! PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
!! the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
!! dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
!! Subroutine F.
!!
!! In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
!! ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
!! columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
!!
!! In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
!! within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
!! manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
!! of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
!! ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
!! The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
!! correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
!! or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by _DLSODA_.
!!
!! JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
!! approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
!!
!! In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
!! so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
!! Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
!! arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
!! intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
!! saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
!! if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
!! JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
!!
!! Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
!! NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
!! (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
!! See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
!!
!! JT
!!
!! : Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
!! JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
!! treated, if and when _DLSODA_ requires this matrix.
!! JT has the following values and meanings:
!!
!! value | description
!! ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
!!     1 | means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
!!     2 | means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
!!       | Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
!!     4 | means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
!!     5 | means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
!!       | ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
!!
!!
!! If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
!! (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
!! If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!##### Optional Inputs.
!!
!! The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
!! call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
!! this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
!! location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
!! The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
!! case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
!! of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
!! Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
!! locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
!! then set those of interest to nonzero values.
!!
!! Name   | Location  |   Meaning and Default Value
!! ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------
!! H0     | RWORK(5)  | the step size to be attempted on the first step.
!!        |           | The default value is determined by the solver.
!!        |           |
!! HMAX   | RWORK(6)  | the maximum absolute step size allowed.
!!        |           | The default value is infinite.
!!        |           |
!! HMIN   | RWORK(7)  | the minimum absolute step size allowed.
!!        |           | The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
!!        |           | enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
!!        |           | when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
!!        |           |
!! IXPR   | IWORK(5)  | flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
!!        |           | IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
!!        |           | IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
!!        |           | T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
!!        |           | unit as used for error messages.
!!        |           |
!! MXSTEP |IWORK(6)   | maximum number of (internally defined) steps
!!        |           | allowed during one call to the solver.
!!        |           | The default value is 500.
!!        |           |
!! MXHNIL |IWORK(7)   | maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
!!        |           | warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
!!        |           | This must be positive to result in a non-default
!!        |           | value.  The default value is 10.
!!        |           |
!! MXORDN |IWORK(8)   | the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
!!        |           | (Adams) method.  the default value is 12.
!!        |           | if MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
!!        |           | be reduced to the default value.
!!        |           | MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
!!        |           |
!! MXORDS |IWORK(9)   | the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
!!        |           | (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
!!        |           | If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
!!        |           | be reduced to the default value.
!!        |           | MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
!!
!!
!! -----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!##### Optional Outputs.
!!
!! As optional additional output from _DLSODA_, the variables listed
!! below are quantities related to the performance of _DLSODA_
!! which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
!! the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
!! except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
!! on any successful return from _DLSODA_, and on any return with
!! ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
!! (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
!! (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
!! On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
!! as noted below.
!!
!! Name   |  Location |    Meaning
!! ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------
!! HU     | RWORK(11) | the step size in t last used (successfully).
!!        |           |
!! HCUR   | RWORK(12) | the step size to be attempted on the next step.
!!        |           |
!! TCUR   | RWORK(13) | the current value of the independent variable
!!        |           | which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
!!        |           | current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
!!        |           | will always be at least as far as the argument
!!        |           | T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
!!        |           |
!! TOLSF  | RWORK(14) | a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
!!        |           | computed when a request for too much accuracy was
!!        |           | detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
!!        |           | the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
!!        |           | left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
!!        |           | scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
!!        |           | then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
!!        |           | (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
!!        |           | tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
!!        |           |
!! TSW    | RWORK(15) | the value of t at the time of the last method
!!        |           | switch, if any.
!!        |           |
!! NST    | IWORK(11) | the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
!!        |           |
!! NFE    | IWORK(12) | the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
!!        |           |
!! NJE    | IWORK(13) | the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
!!        |           | LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
!!        |           |
!! NQU    | IWORK(14) | the method order last used (successfully).
!!        |           |
!! NQCUR  | IWORK(15) | the order to be attempted on the next step.
!!        |           |
!! IMXER  | IWORK(16) | the index of the component of largest magnitude in
!!        |           | the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
!!        |           | on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
!!        |           |
!! LENRW  | IWORK(17) | the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
!!        |           | that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
!!        |           | rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!!        |           | This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!!        |           | input return for insufficient storage.
!!        |           |
!! LENIW  | IWORK(18) | the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
!!        |           | that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
!!        |           | rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
!!        |           | This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
!!        |           | input return for insufficient storage.
!!        |           |
!! MUSED  | IWORK(19) | the method indicator for the last successful step:
!!        |           | 1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!!        |           |
!! MCUR   | IWORK(20) | the current method indicator:
!!        |           | 1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
!!        |           | This is the method to be attempted
!!        |           | on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
!!        |           | only if a method switch has just been made.
!!
!!
!! The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
!! may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
!! For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
!! its base address in RWORK, and its description.
!!
!! Name   | Base Address  |   Description
!! ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------
!! YH     | 21            |the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
!!        |               |(NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
!!        |               |of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
!!        |               |of YH contains HCUR\*\*j/factorial(j) times
!!        |               |the j-th derivative of the interpolating
!!        |               |polynomial currently representing the solution,
!!        |               |evaluated at T = TCUR.
!!        |               |
!! ACOR   |  LACOR        |array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
!!        | (from Common  |corrections on each step, scaled on output
!!        |   as noted)   |to represent the estimated local error in y
!!        |               |on the last step.  This is the vector E in
!!        |               |the description of the error control.  It is
!!        |               |defined only on a successful return from
!!        |               |_DLSODA_.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
!!        |               |including in the user's program the
!!        |               |following 2 lines:
!!        |               |    COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
!!        |               |    LACOR = ILS(22)
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!#### Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
!!
!! The following are optional calls which the user may make to
!! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with _DLSODA_.
!! (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
!! SLATEC error handling package.)
!!
!!  Form of Call                | Function
!!  --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------
!!  CALL XSETUN(LUN)            | set the logical unit number, LUN, for
!!                              | output of messages from _DLSODA_, if

!!                              |

!!                              | a successful return from _DLSODA_.
!!                                                              
!!
!! The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows:
!!
!! The form of the call is:
!!```fortran
!!   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
!!```
!! The input parameters are:
!!
!! T
!!
!! : value of independent variable where answers are desired
!! (normally the same as the T last returned by _DLSODA_).
!! For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
!! (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
!!
!! K
!!
!! : integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
!! 0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
!! (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
!! to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
!! by _DLSODA_ directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
!! derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
!!
!! RWORK(21)
!!
!! : the base address of the history array YH.
!!
!! NYH
!! : column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
!!
!! The output parameters are:
!!
!! DKY
!! : a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
!! of the K-th derivative of y(t).
!!
!! IFLAG
!! : integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
!! -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
!! On an error return, a message is also written.
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!#### Part 3.  Interrupting and Continuing
!!
!! If the solution of a given problem by _DLSODA_ is to be interrupted
!! and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
!! or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
!! following the return from the last _DLSODA_ call prior to the
!! interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and state
!! and later restore these values before the
!! next _DLSODA_ call for that problem.  To save and restore the current
!! state, use Subroutine DSRCMA (see Part 2 above).
!!
!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!!#### Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
!!
!! Below is a description of a routine in the _DLSODA_ package which
!! relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
!! replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
!! a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
!! done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
!! (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
!! superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
!!
!!##### DEWSET
!! The following subroutine is called just before each internal
!! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
!! described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
!!```fortran
!!     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
!!```
!! where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the _DLSODA_ call sequence,
!! YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
!! EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
!!
!! If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
!! (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
!! in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
!! DMNORM routine, and also used by _DLSODA_ in the computation
!! of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
!! quotient Jacobians.
!!
!! In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
!! the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
!! are available from the history array YH, described above under
!! optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
!! extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
!! factors of H\*\*j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
!! given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
!! NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
!! can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
!!```fortran
!!     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
!!     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
!!     NQ = ILS(33)
!!     NST = ILS(34)
!!     H = RLS(212)
!!```
!! Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
!! YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
!! unnecessary when NST = 0).
!!
