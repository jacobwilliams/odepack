## odepack Changelog

The intent of this log is to keep everyone in the loop about what's new
in the odepack project. It is a curated, chronologically ordered list
of notifications of notable events such as bug fixes, new features,
and usage changes.

"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", as they say. When I
find OS (Open Source) resources, I am hoping a lot of these boxes can be
checked ...
